# BubuDesu

BubuDesu is a mobile application developed in Android OS.

A user can interact with each main character from the series: 'Love Live School Idol Festival!' by tapping on the icon of the school idol. As a result, a random quote from that character is played, with an Engish translation being displayed on the bottom. 

The app also features different versions of the popular song "Snow Halation" in the background. The user can control the song being played or mute the song with the floating action buttons on the bottom of the screen.
